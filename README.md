EE405 - Final year project I
# Integrating Multi-Sensor Data and Cardiovascular System Modelling for Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Cardiovascular Diseases

This project pioneers a novel multi-channel pulse sensor inspired by the principles of Naadi Pariksha (Ayurvedic pulse diagnosis), which emphasizes multi-site pulse waveform analysis to assess systemic health. To augment its diagnostic power, PPG is integrated as a complementary modality, replacing standalone SpO2 sensors. PPG not only derives SpO2 through spectral analysis but also provides additional hemodynamic insights, such as perfusion index and vascular compliance, through waveform morphology. When synchronized with ECG (for electrical activity) and phonocardiograms (for heart sounds), this multi-sensor framework creates a holistic profile of cardiovascular function, bridging ancient diagnostic wisdom with modern technology.
